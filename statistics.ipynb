        "Ans--Descriptive and inferential statistics are two fundamental branches of statistics, each serving distinct purposes in data analysis. Below are examples to illustrate their differences and applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Descriptive Statistics Example**:\n",
        "\n",
        "Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the characteristics of a dataset. For instance, consider the test scores of 1,000 students in a school. Using descriptive statistics, you could calculate:\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Mean (Average): The average test score is 82.13, providing a central measure of performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Median: The middle score is 84, indicating that half of the students scored above and half below this value.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Range: The scores range from 45 to 100, showing a spread of 55 points.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Visualization: A histogram could reveal that most students scored between 70 and 90, forming a bell-shaped distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "These statistics help summarize the dataset, making it easier to understand trends and distributions without analyzing individual scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Inferential Statistics Example**:\n",
        "\n",
        "Inferential statistics use a sample to make predictions or draw conclusions about a larger population. For example, suppose you want to estimate the average height of adult women in a country. Instead of measuring every woman, you could:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Sample: Measure the heights of 1,000 randomly selected women.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Confidence Interval: Calculate a 95% confidence interval, such as [155 cm, 163 cm], indicating you are 95% confident the true average height lies within this range.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Hypothesis Testing: Test whether the average height is significantly different from a global average, using statistical tests like a t-test.\n",

This method allows researchers to draw conclusions about a population without needing to survey every individual, saving time and resources while still obtaining accurate results. The goal is to ensure that the sample accurately reflects the characteristics of the population.\n",

        "- Definition: Random sampling is a method where each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. This technique is often used when the population is homogeneous, meaning that individuals have similar characteristics.\n",
        "Process: Members are chosen entirely by chance, often using random number generators or lottery methods. This approach helps minimize bias and ensures that the sample is representative of the population as a whole.\n",

        "**Stratified Sampling**:\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Process: This method ensures that all subgroups are adequately represented in the final sample. For example, if a population consists of 60% females and 40% males, the sample will reflect this ratio.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Advantages: Stratified sampling provides more accurate and reliable results, especially when the population is heterogeneous. It allows for detailed analysis of specific subgroups, which can be crucial for studies focusing on particular characteristics or behaviors"
